        <p>Step-by-step instructions for self-administering Hizentra</p>

<div class="container">
    <p class ="italic">Use this guide only as a supplement to the Hizentra full prescribing information and to personal instruction from your healthcare provider.</p>
    <h3 class ="color">Important Safety Information</h3>
    <p>Hizentra treats various forms of primary immunode ciency (PI) in patients age 2 and over.</p>
    <h5 class = "justify">WARNING: Thrombosis (blood clotting) can occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors can include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, a history of blood clotting or hyperviscosity (blood thickness), use of estrogens, installed vascular catheters, and cardiovascular risk factors.</h5>
    <h5 class = "justify">If you are at high risk of thrombosis, your doctor will prescribe Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable and will monitor you for signs of thrombosis and hyperviscosity. Always drink suf cient  uids before administration.</h5>
    <p class ="justify">Tell your doctor if you have had a serious reaction to other immune globulin medicines or have been told you also have a de ciency of the immunoglobulin called IgA, as you might not be able to take Hizentra. You should not take Hizentra if you know you have hyperprolinemia (too much proline in your blood).</p>
    <h5>Infuse Hizentra under your skin only; do not inject into a blood vessel.</h5>
    <p class ="justify">Allergic reactions can occur with Hizentra. If your doctor suspects you are having a bad allergic reaction or are going into shock, treatment will be discontinued.
    Immediately tell your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have signs of such a reaction, including hives, trouble breathing, wheezing, dizziness, or fainting.</p>
    <p class ="justify">Tell your doctor about any side effects that concern you. Immediately report symptoms that could indicate a blood clot, including pain and/or swelling of an arm or leg, with warmth over affected area; discoloration in arm or leg; unexplained shortness of breath; chest pain or discomfort that worsens with deep breathing; unexplained rapid pulse; and numbness or weakness on one side of the body. Your doctor will also monitor symptoms that could indicate hemolysis (destruction of red blood
    cells), and other potentially serious reactions that have been seen with Ig treatment, including aseptic meningitis syndrome (brain swelling); kidney problems; and transfusion-related acute lung injury.</p>
    <p class ="justify">The most common drug-related adverse reactions in the clinical trial for Hizentra were swelling, pain, redness, heat or itching at the site of injection; headache; back pain; diarrhea; tiredness; cough; rash; itching; nausea and vomiting.</p>
    <p class ="justify">Hizentra is made from components of human blood. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent, cannot be completely eliminated.</p>
    <p class ="justify">Before being treated with Hizentra, inform your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant. Vaccines (such as measles, mumps and rubella) might
    not work well if you are using Hizentra. Before receiving any vaccine, tell the healthcare professional you are being treated with Hizentra.</p>
    <h5>Please see accompanying full prescribing information for Hizentra, including the boxed warning and the patient product information.</h5>
    <p>You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.<br>
        Visit <a href="www.fda.gov/medwatch">www.fda.gov/medwatch</a>, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

    <h3 class ="color">Read before infusing</h3>
    <h5>Important notes</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Administer Hizentra only after you have received training and approval from your healthcare provider</li>
      <li>Before infusing Hizentra:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Read the full prescribing information, patient product information,
              and any additional information given to you by your healthcare provider</li>
          <li>Review the contents of your Hizentra Welcome Kit</li>
          <li>Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Maintain your Hizentra Therapy Journal or MyHizentraTM Infusion Manager app (available through Apple App Store or Google Play) and take it with you every time you see your healthcare provider</li>
      <li>Keep the Hizentra vials in the original box at room temperature (up to 77°F [25°C]) until you are ready to use them</li>
      <li>Hizentra has no preservatives; it is important to throw away any unused product remaining in the vial(s)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>About this guide</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>This infusion guide is meant to help you every step of the way in the infusion process. It is helpful as a teaching tool when you are  rst learning the infusion process, but can also serve as a refresher when you become more comfortable</li>
      <li>Each of the 11 steps is divided into 3 buckets to help you understand where each step  ts in the overall process:</li>
        <ol>

          <li>Clean surface</li>
          <li>Sanitize your hands</li>
          <li>Inspect each vial of Hizentra</li>
          <h4>Get Set</h4>
          <li>Prepare syringe</li>
          <li>Prepare infusion equipment</li>
          <li>Prepare infusion site(s)</li>
          <li>Insert subcutaneous needle(s)</li>
          <h4>Go</h4>
          <li>Start infusion</li>
          <li>Record your infusion</li>
          <li>Complete infusion and clean up</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
      <li>Some steps are simple, while others may take a bit more time – however, they are all important parts of your infusion and should be followed with care</li>

      <li>Hizentra allows you to infuse anytime, anywhere according to your own schedule — it requires no refrigeration</li>
      <li>In the US clinical trial, Hizentra delivered proven protection against infection (0 SBIs*) and demonstrated tolerability (93% of local reactions were mild)</li>
